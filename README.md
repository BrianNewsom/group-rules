PHP FB group posting rules and guidelines
=========================================

This document specifies rules for users and administrators posting in international [PHP group on Facebook][php-group].

Let's build a better environment for discussion, sharing and learning by following some good practices.

Making Posts
------------

* Make sure that the content of the post is related to PHP centric development.
* Use English language only since it is an international group. If English is not your first language, use Google Translate and make the best so everyone will understand or check for your [local PHP user groups][local-php-ug]
* Job opportunities must be PHP related.
* Please avoid anything irrelevant. No literature or poetry here, please!
* Please don't post links to scam sites or your referral accounts or any advertisements.
* If you share something, please add a little description of the share.
* If you want to share your experience or a tutorial, write a blog post and share the link here.
* If you are seeking help, please explain your problem in a concise, well structured and readable manner. Try to put as much information as you can. Code samples can help others understand the issue easily (see Sharing codes point in How to Ask section for details).
* Before asking a question in the group, please try to search on Google first. Your specific problem might have been already faced and solved.
* No hate speech - not against any person or technology.
* No piracy, copyright infringement or illegal objects please!

How to Ask
----------

We'd love to help you. But not every question gets answered. To improve your chances, here are some tips:

* Any question asked should be specific to a problem and the person should provide sample work done and clearly label the problem encountered. The questions should be PHP related and not repetition of what was asked before. 
* Do your homework: Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question? Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found and why it didn't meet your needs. This demonstrates that you've taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and most of all it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer!
* Be specific: If you ask a vague question, you'll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.
* Make it relevant to others: We like to help as many people at a time as we can. Make it clear how your question is relevant to more people than just you, and more of us will be interested in your question and willing to look into it.
* Be on-topic: Our community is defined by a specific set of topics related to PHP and web development technologies; please try to stick to these topics.
* Sharing codes: If you want to share your code, don't write the code in your post, instead please post the code using a code hosting service like http://pastie.org/, http://pastebin.com/, http://codepad.org/, http://codejaw.com/, http://gist.github.com/, http://jsfiddle.net/ or similar and include the link in your post. Also code highlighting is available in these sites which makes it easy to read your code.
* Keep an open mind: The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn't mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn't always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don't agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember â€“ we're just trying to help.

Making Comments
---------------

* Please try to be on topic.
* If your comment doesn't add any value to the post, please refrain from making the comment.
* Respect other people's opinion.
* Constructive debates or arguments with strong logic and appropriate reference are very welcome. Be open and accept different opinions. Heated debates or personal offense is not at all accepted here.
* Please don't spoon feed others. Show them the way to learn and explore. That will be sustainable development for themselves.
* No piracy, copyright infringement or illegal objects please!
* Please don't post your email or phone number, instead send it inside a private message. You can get spammed otherwise.

If by any chance you decide to leave this group, please leave it quietly without bothering other members. As it turns out usually announcements are not very constructive and are hard to be tolerated. Everything comes and goes. If you would like to leave the feedback about the group or help improving this policy, comments are welcome.

Thanks for your understanding and have fun!
