# PHP Facebook group rules

## About

This repository holds do's and don'ts of the PHP Facebook Group a.k.a. the
posting rules and guidelines.

We use Semantic versioning which means each change of the rule increases
and releases a new tag.

Typos and contribution to the rules are welcome by opening a new topic
in the group or opening an issue under the main [wwphp-fb.github.com repository][issues].
